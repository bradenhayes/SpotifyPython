# SpotifyPython

### This script uses Spotify's Spotify for developers. Through a custom made Spotify application this script will copy the "Release Radar" playist every friday when it is updated, generate a new playlist which is named the current date and copy all the songs over.

### The reason the was made is because release radar always updates weekly losing the playlist from the previous week. Now, the playlist will be saved to your Spotify playlists and you will always have access to it.
